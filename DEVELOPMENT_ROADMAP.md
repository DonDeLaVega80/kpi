## Recommended Development Order

```
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5
                                                    ↓
                              Phase 8 ← Phase 7 ← Phase 6
                                ↓
                            Phase 9 → Phase 10 → Phase 11
```

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

To get a working app quickly, prioritize:

1. Phase 0 (Setup)
2. Phase 1 (Data Layer)
3. Phase 2 (UI Foundation)
4. Phase 3 (Developers)
5. Phase 4 (Tickets)
6. Phase 6 (KPI Calculation - basic)
7. Phase 11 (Build)

This gives you a functional app in ~20-25 hours.

## Notes

- Each checkbox can be treated as a commit point
- Test after each phase before moving on
- Keep the UI simple initially, enhance later
- Database migrations should be backward compatible
- Back up your database before testing destructive operations
