## Bug Tracking & KPI

### How Bugs Affect KPI

| Bug Type               | KPI Impact      | Description                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Developer Error**    | Full deduction  | Coding mistake or oversight       |
| **Conceptual**         | Minor deduction | Requirement misunderstanding      |
| **Requirement Change** | No deduction    | Spec changed after implementation |
| **Environment**        | No deduction    | Infrastructure issue              |
| **Third-Party**        | No deduction    | External dependency problem       |

### Bug Resolution Flow

When resolving a bug, you can:

1. **Select who fixed it** - Different from who introduced it
2. **Link a fix ticket** - The ticket created to fix this bug
3. **Log hours spent** - Time tracking for KPI

The system automatically:

- Keeps KPI impact on the developer who **introduced** the bug
- Reassigns the fix ticket to the **resolver**
- Marks the fix ticket as **completed**
- Adds logged hours to the fix ticket

## How KPI is Calculated

### Delivery Score (0-100)

Based on on-time ticket completion:

- **Base**: (on-time tickets / completed tickets) × 100
- **Bonus**: +5 points per early delivery (>1 day early)
- **Penalty**: -10 points per late critical ticket
- **Penalty**: -5 points per reopened ticket

### Quality Score (0-100)

Starts at 100, with deductions based on bugs:

- **Developer Error** bugs: -15 (critical), -10 (high), -5 (medium), -2 (low) per bug
- **Conceptual** bugs: -3 per bug
- **Requirement Change / Environment / Third-Party** bugs: No deduction

### Overall Score

Weighted average of Delivery and Quality scores (configurable in Settings, default: 50/50 split).

### Trend Calculation

Compares current month's overall score with previous 3 months average:

- **Improving**: current > average + 5
- **Stable**: within ±5 of average
- **Declining**: current < average - 5

## Dashboard

The Dashboard provides real-time insights with a comprehensive widget-based layout:

### Primary Metrics

- **Active Developers**: Current count of active team members
- **Open Tickets**: Tickets currently in progress
- **Completed Tickets**: Total completed tickets
- **Average Score**: Team-wide overall KPI average

### Current Month Metrics

- **On-Time Rate**: Average on-time completion rate for the current month
- **Quality Score**: Average quality score for the current month
- **Overdue Tickets Alert**: Visual warning when tickets are past due date

### Performance Tracking

- **Monthly Trend Chart**: Team average overall score over the last 6 months
- **Team KPI Summary**: Individual developer scores with delivery, quality, and overall metrics
- **Recent Activity Feed**: Latest completed tickets and reported bugs with developer names

### Quick Actions

- **Add Ticket**: Create new tickets directly from the dashboard
- **Report Bug**: Report bugs without leaving the dashboard
- **Navigation Links**: Quick access to Developers, Tickets, Bugs, and Reports pages

## Reports & Export

### Monthly Reports

Generate detailed KPI reports for any developer or the entire team:

- **Summary Cards**: Delivery, Quality, and Overall scores
- **Ticket Breakdown**: Bar chart showing completed, on-time, late, and reopened tickets
- **Bug Breakdown**: Pie chart showing bug types (Developer Error, Conceptual, Other)
- **Performance Trend**: Line chart showing score progression over the last 6 months
- **Detailed Metrics**: Comprehensive breakdown of all ticket and bug metrics

### Developer KPI Deep-Dive

View individual developer performance:

- **Average Scores**: Historical averages across all months
- **Latest Month**: Current month performance snapshot
- **Trend Chart**: Visual representation of performance over time
- **Monthly Breakdown Table**: Detailed metrics for each month

### Export Options

- **CSV Export**: Download KPI data as a CSV file for analysis in Excel or other tools
- **PDF Export**: Save reports as HTML files that can be opened in a browser and printed to PDF
- **Native File Dialogs**: Uses system file dialogs for seamless file saving

## Settings & Configuration

### KPI Configuration

Customize how KPI scores are calculated:

- **Score Weights**: Adjust the balance between delivery and quality scores (must sum to 100%)
- **Bug Severity Penalties**: Configure point deductions for each bug severity level
  - Critical: Default 15 points
  - High: Default 10 points
  - Medium: Default 5 points
  - Low: Default 2 points
- **Auto-Save**: Configuration is automatically saved to `config.json`

### Data Management

Comprehensive data management tools:

- **Export All Data (JSON)**: Export all developers, tickets, bugs, and KPI reports to a JSON file
- **Import Data (JSON)**: Import data from a JSON file (automatically reloads the app)
- **Backup Database**: Create timestamped backups of the SQLite database
- **Restore Database**: Restore from a backup file (automatically reloads the app)
- **Clear All Data**: Permanently delete all data with confirmation dialog

### App Preferences

- **Light Mode Only**: The application uses a clean light theme for optimal readability

## Error Handling & User Experience

### Error Boundaries

The application includes React error boundaries to catch and display errors gracefully:

- **UI Error Recovery**: Errors in components are caught and displayed with helpful messages
- **Database Error Detection**: Automatic detection of database corruption with restore options
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages with actionable recovery steps

### Loading States

Enhanced user experience with comprehensive loading indicators:

- **Skeleton Loaders**: Table and card skeleton loaders while data is loading
- **Loading Spinners**: Visual feedback during data fetches and operations
- **Disabled States**: Buttons are automatically disabled during operations to prevent duplicate actions

### Edge Cases

Robust handling of edge cases:

- **Empty States**: Helpful empty state messages with action buttons when no data exists
- **First-Time Setup**: Welcome screen with onboarding guidance for new users
- **Database Corruption**: Automatic detection with options to restore from backup or start fresh
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with recovery paths for common issues

## Performance

### Optimizations

The application is optimized for performance:

- **Pagination**: Large lists automatically paginate (25 items per page by default, configurable)
- **Lazy Loading**: Routes are code-split and loaded on demand, reducing initial bundle size
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized database queries with proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Memoization**: React hooks use memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Database Performance

- **Indexed Queries**: All common query patterns use indexed columns
- **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use prepared statements for security and performance
- **Efficient Aggregations**: KPI calculations use optimized SQL aggregations

## Data Storage

Your data is stored locally at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/kpi-tool/
├── kpi.db          # SQLite database
├── config.json     # KPI configuration (weights, bug penalties)
└── backups/        # Manual database backups (timestamped)
```
